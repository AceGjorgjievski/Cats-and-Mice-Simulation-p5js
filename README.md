# Cats-and-Mice-Simulation
The purpose of this project is the following: There are 3 cats and they are trying to catch 3 mice within 3 seconds. For 100 mice what will be the time to catch them? I did not manage to somehow 'constrain' the cats to catch the mice within 3 seconds. This was made with JavaScript in the p5.js library (Web editor).

Used Literature:
  Most of the code that I have implemented in this project was from 'The Coding Train' YouTube channel.

  I copied the code from 'Evolutionary Steering Behaviors' and made few changes.

**I am sorry for not uploading the images of cat and mouse, you can find on the internet, crop the image, save on desktop and upload it to p5.js
Here is a link for that as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rO6M5hj0V-o

Have a nice day ;")
